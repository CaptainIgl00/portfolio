## Context
**FreeHopper** is an innovative R&D project at Airbus Defense & Space demonstrating **Beam Hopping** for satellite communications. This technology lets a satellite dynamically cover multiple geographic zones, offering unprecedented flexibility in allocating communication resources.

## Initial Challenge
The project faced major challenges:
- Complex test bench with unreliable components
- Manual video-based testing taking 30 minutes
- No automation or structured data collection
- Limited Flask/Dash user interface
- Multiple protocols to handle (HTTP, SPI, USB, proprietary)

## My Contribution

### DevOps Architecture
With the **Cursor IDE** and its integrated AI, I designed and implemented a robust microservices architecture in record time:
