## Context
As an intern at **Continental** in Toulouse, I contributed to the development of **Ultra Wide Band (UWB)** technology, a groundbreaking radio communication already used in everyday devices (AirTags, smartphones). My work led to a **patent filing** and the creation of several innovative test benches.

## Initial Challenge
The project faced several technical hurdles:
- Precise characterization of RF performance (BLE, UWB, 433â€¯MHz)
- Anechoic chamber tests requiring full automation
- UWB mapping around vehicles with performance issues
- Need for real-time data visualization
- Complex integration (LiDAR, CAN, RF)

## My Contribution

### BLE Test Bench
First bench developed for tire pressure sensors:
- **Interface**: PyQt6 application
- Real-time visualization
- Configurable tests
